# Cognitive Scripts Project
This project is about cognitive scripts, a set of information instructions that an agent uses to recall knowledge about a certain domain.

## What are cognitive scripts?
Cognitive scripts are a method of representing semantic and procedural knowledge. Scripts are like frames, except the values that fill the slots must be ordered. A cognitive script is a structured representation describing a generic sequence of events in a particular context.
